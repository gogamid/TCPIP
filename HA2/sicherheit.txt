FTP was not built to be secure. It is generally considered to be an insecure protocol because it relies on clear-text usernames and passwords for authentication and does not use encryption. Data sent via FTP is vulnerable to sniffing, spoofing, and brute force attacks, among other basic attack methods.
FTP can be improved by using Strong Encryption and Hashing. Others are: 
*Implement IP Blacklists and Whitelists
*Utilize Good Account Management
*Use Strong Passwords
*Implement File and Folder Security

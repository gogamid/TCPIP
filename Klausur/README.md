# TCPIP-Programmierung SoSe 2021 – Klausuraufgabe - smb – Simple Message Broker

## Task 

This exam project focuses on developing simple message broker architecture. A message consists
the tuple topic (subject) and message (value, content), where
topic and message are to be implemented as simple strings. If the
hashtag # is used as topic, all messages are forwarded from the broker to the
subscriber. The broker does not store the messages
but forwards a message only if the topic has been subscribed to by a subscriber.
subscriber has subscribed to it. The communication between broker and publisher
or broker and subscriber is done via UDP.
## Broker: smbbroker.c

## Publisher smbpublish.c 

## Subscriber: smbsubscribe.c
